# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
In this project, we assesed the utility of a few supervised machine learning models with respect to credit risk. We started with oversampling and undersampling models, then we combined these two approaches, and finally we used bias-reducing models. The goal was to compare these models and see which ones worked the best with such a feature-heavy dataset.

## Results
